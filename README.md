[publico-cargos.txt](publico-cargos.txt) a list of Portuguese noun quantifiers, i.e., words that occur before a proper noun, gathered from [publico.pt](http://www.publico.pt).

[publico-acronyms.txt](publico-acronyms.txt) a list of acronyms and it's possible extensions, extracted from a collection of Portuguese news gathered from [publico.pt](http://www.publico.pt).

The acronyms were automatically extracted with [A Simple Algorithm for Identifying Abbreviation Definitions in Biomedical Text] (http://biotext.berkeley.edu/papers/psb03.pdf) by A.S Schwartz and M.A. Hearst. A Java implementation is available [here](http://biotext.berkeley.edu/code/abbrev/).
